## Local Execution steps:

Firstly, we must launch our compiler using the gcc instruction as follow below: gcc -fopenmp omp_mxm.c -o SalidaXXX

Where:

*gcc-> Our compiler version of C language
*fopenmp ->A flag provided to load correctly openmp libraries needed to our purposes.
*SalidaXXX -> Which is our outcome once we compile correctly our code. XXX represents the number of compilation we are. 
*omp_mxm.c-> Our implementation using omp directives.

Once we get our outcome is just to execute it by typing the next line: 
./SalidaXX
